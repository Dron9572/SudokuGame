# The project for the subject "C Programming"

This is my first big program written in C during my studies.

This project was written in the C programming language, utilizing only standard libraries and methods inherent to the C language.

Sudoku offers a captivating digital rendition of the classic Sudoku puzzle. Dive into the challenge of filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, column, and 3x3 section contains all the numbers from 1 to 9.
